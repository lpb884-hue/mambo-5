<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mambo Number Five
One, two, three, four, five
Everybody in the car, so come on, let's ride
To the liquor store around the corner
The boys say they want some gin and juice
But I really don't wanna
Beer-bust like I had last week
I must stay deep because talk is cheap
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita
And as I continue, you know they getting sweeter (uh)
So what can I do? I really beg you, my Lord
To me is flirting is just like a sport
Anything fly, it's all good, let me dump it
Please set in the trumpet</p>
<ol><li>A little bit of Monica in my life</li>
<li>A little bit of Erica by my side</li>
<li>A little bit of Rita's all I need</li>
<li>A little bit of Tina's what I see</li>
<li>A little bit of Sandra in the sun</li>
<li>A little bit of Mary all night long</li>
<li>A little bit of Jessica, here I am</li>
<li>A little bit of you makes me your man (ah)</li></ol>
<p>Mambo Number Five (ah)
Jump up and down and move it all around
Shake your head to the sound
Put your hand on the ground
Take one step left and one step right
One to the front and one to the side
Clap your hand once and clap your hands twice
And if it looks like this then you're doing it right</p>
<ol><li>A little bit of Monica in my life</li>
<li>A little bit of Erica by my side</li>
<li>A little bit of Rita's all I need</li>
<li>A little bit of Tina's what I see</li>
<li>A little bit of Sandra in the sun</li>
<li>A little bit of Mary all night long</li>
<li>A little bit of Jessica, here I am</li>
<li>A little bit of you makes me your man (ah)</li></ol>

'Cause you can't run and you can't hide
You and me gonna touch the sky
